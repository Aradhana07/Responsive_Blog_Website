        <h1 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Mountain Souls</h1>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">Adventure had been interestingly in the Himalayas leading 
            a group of 15 year olds around the Annapurna Mountain
            way back in 1997 when the concept of connectivity, 
            Sherpas, etc. was a luxury. While I continued my
            general fitness goals and led an active lifestyle 
            the mountains were left behind. Exactly a year ago
            a friend of mine mentioned The Kashmir Great Lakes
            and in a moment of weakness, I said HELL YA – let’s
            do it. Little did I know that this would be the 
            beginning of a crazy 12 months that included
            successful completion of the Great Lakes trek,
            a busted knee on the final descent, a period
            of 6 months of Exercise Therapy Rehab at Invictus,
            and then an attempt of Everest Base Camp & Island
            Peak in April this year.

                <h3>Himanchal Pradesh-Town of valley</h3><br>
                <li> small town of Manali is an adventure travel hub in the summer lover for its cooler mountain climate, although it is snowbound in the winter. One of the things that makes Manali so appealing to hikers is that it's an easy jumping-off point for long and short hikes in this northern part of Himachal Pradesh. Manali itself sits within the Kullu Valley, and is a couple of hours' drive below the Rohtang Pass, a mountain pass that leads to the Spiti Valley and Ladakh.</li>
                <br>
                <h3>Spiti Valley</h3>
                <img src="./assets/Spiti.webp" height="350" width="550" alt="spiti-valley">
                <li>Nestled between Manali and Ladakh, the Spiti Valley is similar to Ladakh in landscape and culture but is even more remote and sees fewer travelers because it's such a challenge to reach. Several high-altitude treks can be enjoyed here, hiking between whitewashed clifftop monasteries and patchworks of irrigated fields around villages. Most of the treks here are considered challenging because of their altitudes and the number of high passes along the way, including the Kunzum Pass (15,000 feet), the Hamta Pass (14,000 feet), and the Pin Bhaba Pass (16,000 feet)</li>
                <br>

                <img src="./assets/manali.webp" height="350" width="550" alt="manali">
                <li> Manali also offers convenient access to the more remote Parvati Valley and Malana Valley and is where you can find tour companies who will arrange guided treks into these isolated valleys.</li>

                <li>Manali is a town, near Kullu town in Kullu district in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh.[2] It is situated in the northern end of the Kullu Valley, formed by the Beas River. The town is located in the Kullu district, approximately 270 kilometres (170 mi) north of the state capital of Shimla and 544 kilometres (338 mi) northeast of the national capital of New Delhi. Manali is a popular tourist destination in India and serves as the gateway to the Lahaul and Spiti district as well as the city of Leh in Ladakh.</li>

                <h3>Valley of the flowers National Park</h3><br>
                <li>The name says it all: the Valley of Flowers National Park, in the Chamoli District of Uttarakhand, erupts in a frenzy of wildflowers in the summer. The sheer amount of biodiversity in the park is the reason that it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's only open to visitors between July and September, which is the best time to see the wildflowers but is also the monsoon season, so hikers should expect rain and mud rather than perfectly clear mountain views. The two-to-three-day trek starts in the village of Ghangaria and is classed as moderate, with some easy and some strenuous parts.</li>

                <h3>Nanada Devi National Park(UK)</h3>
                <li>The mighty Himalayan mountain range contains several of the highest mountains in the world, but most of them are in Nepal or on the border of Nepal and India. The highest peak that is completely in India is Nanda Devi (at 25,643 feet), in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand. The Nanda Devi National Park is near the Valley of Flowers, right on the border with southwestern Tibet.
                    Popular treks in this park include the Nanda Devi Base Camp Trek and the Nanda Devi Sanctuary Trek. Both provide views of the 23rd highest mountain in the world and are classified as moderate-to-difficult treks, so they are best suited to experienced hikers.
                </li>

                <h3>Gangotri (Uttarakhand)</h3>
                <li>Treks in the Gangotri area of the Garhwal Himalaya of Uttarakhand bring hikers to the Gangotri Glacier, the source of the sacred River Ganga. The glacier is huge, at 17 miles long and 2.5 miles wide, and treks in its vicinity range from two to five days. All of the trails are at high altitudes of between 13,000 and 21,000 feet, so care should be taken to acclimatize properly and not rush the trek.If a challenging high-altitude hike isn't what you're looking for, there are other Hindu pilgrimage routes in the area and temples to visit.</p>

                <h3>Ladakh — A desert and a lake in the mountains</h3>
                <p>The land of high passes, Ladakh is a region in the
                     Kashmir state of India. With its series of majestic 
                     mountains, the coldest desert on earth where double-humped 
                     Bactrian camels are ready to take you on a ride,
                      Pangong Tso Lake made famous by the Indian movie 
                      The Three Idiots, the highest motorable road in the 
                      world, warm, honest and hospitable natives, some 
                      intricately worked silver jewelry and miles after 
                      miles of drives among snow-capped mountains and
                       glaciers, Ladakh doesn’t fail to provide
                      a multi-dimensional and unforgettable experience.
                     
                </p>

               <br><br>
                <h3>A Lot of Firsts!</h3>
                <li>It was the first time in Leh, the capital of Ladakh, 
                that I came across what’s known as acclimatization.
                When we landed after a flight from Delhi, we got busy
                taking photos of the mountains surrounding the runway.
              </li>
    
                <li>Also for the first time in my life,
                I had to answer the call of nature in the great wide open. 
                I took ages before I could muster enough courage to do the job,
                gently coaxing and scolding myself in turns to get it on as my 
                friends and spouse waited in the off-road while I hid behind a 
                giant boulder.
            </li>
    
               <h3>The Highest Motorable Road</h3>
               <li>The drive to Khardung-La Pass, the highest motorable
                 road in the world at an altitude of 18,380 feet, was
                  probably both the first and the last time for me.
                   I was dizzy, nauseous, cold, hungry, and too afraid
                    to eat lest that meant another episode of unzipping
                     my pants in the open. Ladakh is both the largest and the second least populous union territory of India.
                      </li>

                <br><br>
                 <h3>Pangong Tso Lake</h3>
                 <li>Another highlight of this amazing mountain trip was the
                     Pangong Tso Lake, at a height of more than 14,000 feet.
                      The skies were grey and it snowed a little while we were there so,
                       we were not favored with the bright turquoise view of the lake.
                        We stopped at the restaurant called The Three Idiots after the 
                        famed Amir Khan movie and warmed our hands around steaming hot
                         bowls of Maggi noodles.The chai or tea that I was expecting in 
                         Kashmir was the one I had in Pakistan — a creamy pink concoction
                          with slivers of pistachio and almond floating lazily on the
                           surface.And also the prospect
                           of having a stopover in Kolkata on our way back home</li>
                            <video width="500" height="343" controls >

                            </video><br>
    
                            <li>However, all my tea-related disappointment melted away when
                                 I got my hands on some pretty silver jewelry that I would 
                                 not trade for all the jewels in the world. And also the prospect
                                  of having a stopover in Kolkata on our way back home. 
                                  It was the first time in Leh, the capital of Ladakh, that I came across what’s known as acclimatization. When we landed after a flight from Delhi, we got busy taking photos of the mountains surrounding the runwayI recommand you to visit the ladakh</li>

        <h1>About Me!</h1><hr><br>
        <p>Hello Guys, My name is Aradhana Singh And i'm graduate in 2023 from B.Tech(CSE).</p>
         <p>I am from Renukoot which located in really small district. I have done my schooling from my hometown.
            As for my interest in my free time I like cooking, listening devotional music and reading books.</p>
         <br>
        <p> I have really interest in mountains thats why I'm creating a blog website realted to the mountains.My thoughts on the Moutains
            is really advantoures . And in india there are lots of moutains and the most highes mountaineer to climb on it.The first most person which climb on it is <strong>Edmund Hillary and Tibetan Mountaineer Tenging Norgay.</strong>
        </p><br>
            <b>The mountains are good for the soul</b>
            <p>
            I have never in my life claimed to be an adventurer or outdoors lover – until I started hiking in the mountains. With the lovely, lush green forests and foothills, the tantalizing teal lakes hidden away like a secret prize waiting to be found, and those stunning sky-high jagged peaks, it was love at first sight. But more than that, hiking in the mountains became an immediate passion because of the way it made me feel. I was able to just be the real me and connect with the version of myself that felt the most authentic and true.</p>
         <br>
            <b>They have healing powers</b>
        <p>. Maybe it’s that dose of fresh mountain air, the exercise or the litres of water I drink when I’m hiking, but I swear to you that after a visit to the mountains I feel enormously better. It’s as if there is an energy source in those summits that you can tap into and feed off of. Getting out there literally fuels you and rebalances you; you will notably feel more calm and happy, and less irritable or anxious. There was never a time that I left the mountains without feeling refreshed, happy and inspired – ready to take on anything that came my way.</p>
